# 🌊 AquaSafe – Groundwater Purity Monitoring System  
### Smart India Hackathon 2025 – Working Prototype

AquaSafe is a web-based groundwater analysis tool that calculates the Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HMPI) and visualizes contamination levels using maps, graphs, and downloadable reports.
This project was built as part of SIH 2025, focusing on simplifying water-quality monitoring for environmental researchers and public health agencies.

This project aims to modernize groundwater monitoring by reducing manual calculation errors and enabling faster, more accurate analysis.
